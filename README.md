# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning 


# The Deep Reinforcement Learning Course # 
by HuggingFace ðŸ¤— will teach about Deep Reinforcement Learning from beginner to expert:

# UNIT-1: 
"LunarLander" agent that will learn to land correctly on the Moon using PPO architecture and MLpPolicy and the trained agent is uploaded into the Hugging Face Hub.

# BONUS UNIT-1: 
"Huggy" the Dog to fetch the stick and then play with him directly in your browser

# UNIT-2: 
"FrozenLake-v1" where our agent will need to go from the starting state (S) to the goal state (G) by walking only on frozen tiles (F) and avoiding holes (H).

"Taxi-v3" will need to learn to navigate a city to transport its passengers from point A to point B. [Taxi-v3](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/notebooks/unit2/unit2.ipynb#scrollTo=RpOTtSt83kPZ)--->

# UNIT-3:
"Deep Q-Learning with Atari Games using RL Baselines3 Zoo" This is a trained model of a DQN agent playing SpaceInvadersNoFrameskip-v4 using the stable-baselines3 library and the RL Zoo.[Deep Q-Learning with Atari Games using RL Baselines3 Zoo](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit3/hands-on?fw=pt)--->[Result:](https://huggingface.co/MrDivakaruni/dqn-SpaceInvadersNoFrameskip-v4)

# UNIT-4:
"Cartpole and PixelCopter" In this notebook,coded first Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm from scratch: Reinforce also called Monte Carlo Policy Gradient.
[Code your first Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm And test its robustness.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/notebooks/unit4/unit4.ipynb#scrollTo=CjRWziAVU2lZ)

# UNIT-5:
"ML Agents: Snownball Target and Pyramids Training" In this notebook, The first one will learn to shoot snowballs onto spawning targets and The second need to press a button to spawn a pyramid, then navigate to the pyramid, knock it over,and move to the gold brick at the top.
